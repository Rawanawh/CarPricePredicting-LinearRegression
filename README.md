### Abstract
The purchase of a car can take a considerable amount of time. Deciding whether a car is worth the posted price when you see listings online can be difficult. It is possible to determine the actual worth of a car based on many factors, including the mileage, make, model, and year. The aim is to develop models based on our data to predict car prices using machine learning algorithms. We would like to know.

### Conclusion 

Linear Regrassion model MSE Test Score = 0.005

Lasso Regression model after feature selection MSE Test Score = 0.009

Ridge Regression Model  MSE Test Score = 0.005

Best model is Linear Regrassion & Ridge Regrassion with MSE = 0.005
